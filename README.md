## 📚 Introduction

This repository contains my solutions for the [1337 School](https://1337.ma/) C++ Pool - a comprehensive series of exercises designed to teach Object-Oriented Programming using C++. The curriculum progressively introduces fundamental C++ concepts through hands-on projects that demonstrate the language's key features and methodologies.

## 🗂️ Structure

The repository is organized into modules (cpp00 through cpp09), each containing exercises that focus on specific C++ concepts:

| Module | Focus | Key Concepts |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **[CPP00](./cpp00/)** | Basics | Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const |
| **[CPP01](./cpp01/)** | Memory | Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement |
| **[CPP02](./cpp02/)** | Operators | Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, canonical form |
| **[CPP03](./cpp03/)** | Inheritance | Class inheritance, virtual functions |
| **[CPP04](./cpp04/)** | Polymorphism | Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces |
| **[CPP05](./cpp05/)** | Exceptions | Try/catch blocks, exception handling |
| **[CPP06](./cpp06/)** | Casting | C++ casts (static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast) |
| **[CPP07](./cpp07/)** | Templates | Template functions and classes, specialization |
| **[CPP08](./cpp08/)** | STL | Containers, iterators, algorithms |
| **[CPP09](./cpp09/)** | Advanced | Container implementation and usage |

## 💻 Usage

Each project directory contains a Makefile. To compile and run a specific exercise:

```bash
cd cpp0X/exY
make
./program_name [arguments if necessary]
```
